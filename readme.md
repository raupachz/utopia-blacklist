# Utopia Blacklist ✊🌲⚑
This is not only a simple JSON file. It is a utopian idea of a better internet and a better world. This list contains domains and tags of companies, parties or associations that are dangerous for the common good of this world.

There are many things you can do with such a list. Lock your software against certain uses, block data traffic or automate various tasks.

## Contribute
Help me to expand this list. There are many topics and domains missing. Just add domains to the list and add some tags.
Note: For the moment I will only accept pull requests from known people or collectives.
