# Utopia Blacklist
Make bullshit machine readable. This is not only a simple JSON file. It is a utopian idea of a better internet and a better world.

There are many things you can do with such a list. Lock your software against certain uses, block data traffic or automate various tasks.

## Contribute
Help me to expand this list. Just add domains to an existing list and add some tags.
Note: For the moment I will only accept pull requests from known people.
